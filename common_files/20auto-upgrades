# which — as its name suggest — can automatize the upgrade process for some packages (by default it only
# takes care of security updates, but this can be customized in /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/50unattended-upgrades).
# Note that this option can be set with the help of debconf by running dpkg-reconfigure -plow unattended-upgrades.
# If apt-listbugs is installed, it will prevent an automatic upgrade of packages which are affected by an already
# reported serious or grave bug.

# This option covers a feature that apticron doesn't have. It controls how often obsolete packages
# (those not referenced by any distribution anymore) are removed from the APT cache. This keeps the APT
# cache at a reasonable size and means that you don't need to worry about that task.
